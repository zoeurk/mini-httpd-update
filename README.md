# mini-httpd for POST with data

I give you this mini-httpd update.  
This give the ability to POST data(function finish_request, see __man shutdown__) and PHP_REDIRECT for __cgi__.  

I have give this file to responsable of the project but I don't know what is done...  
So I don't talk about liscense.
