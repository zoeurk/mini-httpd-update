# mini-httpd for POST with data

I give you this update of mini-httpd.  
This give the ability to POST data(function finish_request, see __man shutdown__) and REDIRECT_STATUS for __php-cgi__.  
In config file you can add this key: __server_redirect__  
On the command line it is understand by '__-R__'
  
I have give this file to responsable of the project but I don't know what is it about...  
So I don't talk about liscense.  
  
It's possible and lok like to be easy to add syslog ability (*make_log_entry()*)...  
  
Maybe a nice choice for hidden service with TOR (Tor Onion Router) on Linux ;)
